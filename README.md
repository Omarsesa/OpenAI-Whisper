# OpenAI-Whisper

## Auto instantaneous translation using AI and IoT



## Introduction:

*We  used **Whisper** tool to create application  that can transcribe in multiple languages, as well as translate from those languages into English
*  



## Technologies:



* Jupyter
* Whisper library
* Numpy library
* Torch library
* os library
* Sounddevice library
* Wavio library
*  Scipy.io.wavfile.write
* Streamlit

## Summary:

> we made an application to hear the speech and then speak it on speaker in English using AI 
We used in AI these libraries 
We have used Whisper because its ability to transcribe speech audio to text in spoken language (ASR) as well as translate it into English
At first we received the sound from the microphone using sound device This will convert the NumPy array to an audio file
Then we used scipy.io.wavfile and wavio which convert the audio file to text
Then we used  Torch framework, which works with extensive support for machine learning algorithms that put GPUs first
Then we used pyttsx3 to convert the translated speech into audio to be displayed on the speakers
We also uploaded the code on raspberry pi and connected it with a microphone and speaker to receive the voice and translate it with the code the send the translated text to the speaker to make the audio more loud and clear.
